## **Heap**
1. Heap is Formed from Full Binary Tree i.e complete till level h-1 and then filled form left to right at level h
2. At any index i in array, it's child is 2*i and (2*i+1) and parent is floor(i/2).
3. Time taken to insert value in Heap in O(log(N)) i.e O(log(height of Tree)) and in worst case element may be leaf node i.e hight = log(n).
4. Priority Queue in C++ in example of heap.
