# Heap

Itâ€™s a complete tree (All levels are completely filled except possibly the last level and the last level has all keys as left as possible). This property of Binary Heap makes them suitable to be stored in an array.

### Min heap

A Min-Heap is a complete binary tree in which the value in each internal node is smaller than or equal to the values in the children of that node. 
Mapping the elements of a heap into an array is trivial: if a node is stored at index k, then its left child is stored at index 2k + 1 and its right child at index 2k + 2.

```
            5                      13
         /      \               /       \  
       10        15           16         31 
      /                      /  \        /  \
    30                     41    51    100   41
```

### Max heap
A Max-Heap is a complete binary tree in which the value in each internal node is greater than or equal to the values in the children of that node.
Mapping the elements of a heap into an array is trivial: if a node is stored a index k, then its left child is stored at index 2k + 1 and its right child at index 2k + 2.

For any position in array Arr[i]:
* Arr[(i-1)/2] Returns the parent node.
* Arr[(2*i)+1] Returns the left child node.
* Arr[(2*i)+2] Returns the right child node.

* Insertion in heap takes O(log(n)) in worst case
